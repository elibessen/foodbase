## Overview

- **Secure, reliable authentication.** Login using your email and password without worrying about any leaks.
- **Always running.** Once the app is running, it never stops. Thats a Firebase guarantee. (Unless you stop it).
- **Modern interface.** Always using the latest Bootstrap version to create a sleek, modern and responsive experience.
- **Seperate teacher interface.** Teachers can see each students order and edit them individually or see an overview of every order.
- **Easy to understand.** No training, no prior-knowledge, nothing.
